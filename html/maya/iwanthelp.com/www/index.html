                        <!--iWantHelp is a leading international BPO company, with the highest level of experts who will
                         be there to assist you in all your company needs. Let us explain a bit what BPO is and how it
                         can work to the advantage of your company: -->

                        <!--What is Business Process Outsourcing?
                        BPO is having an outside company process your business services, thus replacing in-house services you provide. We can categorize BPO into two main areas: back office outsourcing which would be replacing your internal business functions such as Human Resources, finance and accounting, and front office outsourcing which would include customer-related services like contact center services. Our BPO is the best solution for your company. It will save you time and money every time. You see, when you have iWantHelp assisting you in all your outsourcing needs your company is able to focus on its core competencies, without being weighed down by the demands of bureaucratic restraints. Key employees are then released from performing non-core or administrative processes and can use the extra time and energy in building the firm’s core businesses. iWantHelp will, thus, give you the freedom to achieve operational excellence, by increasing the speed of business processes, and allowing you to focus on what it mostly important for your company: its growth. You will be able to maintain growth goals while forgetting about standard business bottlenecks. By freeing your employees from all the bureaucratic struggles like payment solutions and fraud control, among others, you and your employees will be able to give your full attention to sales, product improvement, new product development, among others, all the while being certain that all the back office and front office tasks we cover will be handled in the best, most professional manner, and that your interests will be ours. Your BPO will be provided efficiently, ensuring that none of the areas we provide for will be left to slack, and that your customers will be treated in the most caring way. All their issues, be it big or small will be solved in a timely and friendly manner. Your customers will experience 100% customer satisfaction, ensuring they will always return.
                        iWantHelp will provide services that allow your company to retain your entrepreneurial speed and agility, which would otherwise have to be sacrificed in order to increase efficiency as you expand. In fact, by using our services your company may be able to grow at a faster pace as it will be less constrained by large capital expenditures for people or equipment that may take years to pay off, may become outdated or turn out to be a poor match for the company over time. Also, by doing all the Human Resources part of the areas we handle, we’ll empower your HR to acquire only those employees that are key to the core processes. By putting your non-core processes in our capable hands, you can concentrate on increasing your sales and market share, develop new products and even spread out into new markets. We will be key to the factors of scalability and scope. Companies that want to grow internationally must continuously invest in infrastructure and find talent around the world which would require too much time, money and effort in searching for the right people. You need not waste your efforts as we have already done it for you.
                        As an added plus, iWantHelp will cater to your customers changing needs. This is another great advantage we procure for your company. iWantHelp provides management with very flexible and scalable services to meet the customers' changing requirements, and support restructuring issues such as acquisitions, consolidations, and joint ventures.
                        And beyond all of these advantages, maybe the most important is the achievement of cost reductions. This is made possible through process improvements, reengineering, and use of technologies that reduce and bring costs under control. iWantHelp guarantees that your operational costs will go down, while your productivity goes up. What could be better?
                        iWantHelp on BPO security
                        Information security is a significant concern for businesses that use call centers or business process outsourcing, and rightfully so. If you cannot protect your data, you put your business at risk. iWantHelp is aware of the threats and issues concerning information loss and theft and is at all times working hard to ensure the privacy of the information you put in our hands.
                        iWantHelp, besides providing you with the experience and the expertise to cover all of your needs, also provides the security needed to keep your sensitive assets safe at all times. We have top of the line security programs and our IT and developers are focused on all aspects of customer information protection, creating new control structures as they are required, using the highest data leakage prevention technology to manage data flows.
                        Furthermore, where other companies prefer to hire cheap labor and even might forego background checks, all our employees are checked thoroughly, monitored and constantly updated in the newest security policies and standards. We reinforce policies by education, vigilance and audit. And we do our job well, as we aim for the best value, rather than the lowest cost in labor.
                        In addition, we also guarantee that your databases will never be mixed with other clients’ as we make sure all company information is handled separately and with the utmost sensitivity.
                        When choosing iWantHelp to handle your outsourcing needs you are not only getting the best BPO available, you will also be ensuring the protection of your data through the following:
                        Network protection

                                    Customer service is a foundation for organizational success and profitability. Customer service done
                                    right rewards you with repeat business, loyalty, cross-selling opportunities and word-of-mouth

                                            But customer service — online or on the phone — is costly. Labour costs rise and technological
                                            advances mean customers expect more.
                                            The solution is customer service outsourcing. Delegate your customer service to allow your
                                            organization to consolidate operations, increase responsiveness and reduce costs.
